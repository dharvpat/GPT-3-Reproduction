# Project: GPT-3 Replication with Dynamic Model Selection

## Project Objectives

- **Replicate GPT-3's Architecture with Dynamic Model Selection:** Implement a Transformer-based language model that dynamically adjusts sizes based on user input.
- **Reproduce Training Methodology:** Utilize the same data sources, preprocessing steps, and training procedures as the original GPT-3.
- **Demonstrate Few-Shot Learning Capabilities:** Validate the model's performance in few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot learning across various NLP tasks.
- **Benchmark Performance:** Evaluate the models using the benchmarks from the original paper to compare performance.
- **Provide Extensive Documentation and User Guidance:** Offer clear instructions, technical documentation, and user guides to facilitate replication and further research.
