# Hyperparameters Guide

This guide provides insights into the hyperparameters used in training the GPT-3 models and how to adjust them.

---

## Key Hyperparameters

### Learning Rate

- **Default**: Depends on model size; typically starts around 1e-4.
- **Warm-Up**: Use a warm-up phase to gradually increase the learning rate.
- **Decay Schedule**: Implement decay strategies like cosine annealing.

### Batch Size

- **Definition**: Number of sequences processed in one forward/backward pass.
- **Adjustment**: Larger batch sizes can stabilize training but require more memory.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple steps.

### Sequence Length

- **Default**: 1024 or 2048 tokens.
- **Considerations**: Longer sequences capture more context but increase memory usage.

### Optimizer

- **Type**: AdamW optimizer is recommended.
- **Beta Values**: Typically set to (0.9, 0.95).
- **Weight Decay**: Small values like 0.01 help regularize the model.

### Dropout

- **Default**: Usually set to 0.1.
- **Purpose**: Prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

## Advanced Hyperparameters

### Gradient Clipping

- **Value**: Clip gradients to a maximum norm (e.g., 1.0).
- **Purpose**: Prevent exploding gradients.

### Mixed Precision Training

- **Flag**: `--fp16`
- **Benefits**: Reduces memory usage and can speed up training.

### Gradient Checkpointing

- **Flag**: `--gradient_checkpointing`
- **Purpose**: Saves memory by recomputing activations during backward pass.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Start with Defaults**: Use default values provided in the training configurations.
- **Adjust Gradually**: Change one hyperparameter at a time to isolate effects.
- **Monitor Metrics**: Keep an eye on training loss, validation loss, and other metrics.

## Recommendations

### Smaller Models

- **Higher Learning Rates**: Can often tolerate higher learning rates.
- **Simpler Schedules**: May not require complex learning rate schedules.

### Larger Models

- **Lower Learning Rates**: Prevent divergence during training.
- **Longer Warm-Up**: Helps stabilize initial training phases.
- **Advanced Optimization**: Consider using optimization libraries like DeepSpeed.
