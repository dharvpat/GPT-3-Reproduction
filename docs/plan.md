### Step 1: Literature Review and Planning
- Understand the GPT-3 architecture.
    - Study the paper and understand the scaling laws as they apply to model performance
- Define project scope and objectives.
    - Clarify goals and success Criteria

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
- Use Python with PyTorch for the ewasue of use and simplicity in defining custom architectures.
- Secure access to high-performance GPUs.

### Step 3: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Acquire datasets.
    - Download Common Crawl snapshots and other datasets.
- PreProcess Datasets
    - Implement Tokenization with a specified vocab size
- Data Management.
    - Organize data into shards and sequences for easy loading to python

### Step 4: Implement the Dynamic Model Architecture
- Define and implement model configurations.
    - Create a model_configs file in either yaml or json to capture the configurations for each model size. Include all hyperparameters.
- Develop model classes
    - The different model classes will be differentiated by the model config used to make them. This will help scalability when training different models
- Implement CLI for model selection using argparse

### Step 5: Optimize code for Large-Scale usage
- organize cod einto modules: `models/`, `/training/`, `utils/` all serve a purpose. Define that in the __init__.py files.
- Check if current system reources are enough to train the selected model
- Optimization Algorithm: use AdamW, use for adaptive Learning rates and decoupled weight decay.

### Step 6: Training the Model
- Adjust batch sizes and learning rates based on model size. (Hyperparameter Tuning)
- Monitor training and implement checkpointing using logs.

### Step 7: Implementing Few-Shot Learning
- Design prompts for various tasks.
- Develop efficient inference pipelines.

### Step 8: Evaluation and Benchmarking
- Prepare and run evaluations on benchmark datasets.

### Step 9: Documentation and Reporting
- Update all documentation and create final reports.
