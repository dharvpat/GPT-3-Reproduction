## Introduction

The GPT-3 Reproduction Project aims to replicate the GPT-3 language model as described in the paper "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" by Brown et al. This project provides:

- Dynamic model selection among various GPT-3 sizes.
- Tools for training, evaluating, and using the models.
- Extensive documentation and examples.

**Note:** Due to the computational resources required, training larger models (e.g., 175B parameters) may not be feasible for everyone. The project allows you to select a model size that fits your resources.
